# Features to add:
## Warp-flight effects

  - visual
    - Background color or skybox replacement
  - audio
    - engine sound based in speed
    - sound when dropping out
  - gameplay
    - drag is always on, slowing the ship down by a lot. 
    - heavy damage to the ship makes it drop out of warp
    - entering the warp gives you an initial impact in direction of the ships forward vector, so its favorable to start facing in the right direction.


What happens if you speeddrop into a sector that is drop-shielded (noEntry)?
- random drop could be used for fast, untraceable getaways -> cant be followed
- drop to closest available exitpoint?
