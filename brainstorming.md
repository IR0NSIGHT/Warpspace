# Features to add:
## Warp-flight effects

  - visual
    - Background color or skybox replacement
  - audio
    - engine sound based in speed
    - sound when dropping out [done]
  - gameplay
    - drag is always on, slowing the ship down by a lot - pull inhibitors or nearby stars have huge drag/gravity?. 
    - heavy damage to the ship makes it drop out of warp
    - entering the warp gives you an initial impact in direction of the ships forward vector, so its favorable to start facing in the right direction.
