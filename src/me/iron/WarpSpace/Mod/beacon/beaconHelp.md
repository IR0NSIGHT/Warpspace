# Warp beacons
beacons are special chambers that shift the natural dropsectors to the position of the beacon.
Any ships dropping at the closest warpsector, will drop in the beacons sector.
How to use:
- build a station
- give it a reactor and an FTL chamber
- select "Warpbeacon" from the reactor tree
- in "functionality" rightclick the beacon to charge and activate it

Utility:
- droppoint marked on the map gets shifted and now has a little border around it.
- in warp it will display the beacons coordinates instead of the natural droppoint.
- beacons work unloaded and across server restarts.
- beacons only work on:
    - stations
    - non-homebases
    - undamaged chambers
    - not overheating stations

Limitations:
- Sometimes server-client synch gets mixed up and it will show "active" when its not. restart the station and activate again.
